  <h2>Books</h2>

<p>
I love reading. I grew up an avid reader, but like most people I stopped reading as much in high school and college. Two years ago during summer break, I found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands and started reading again. Ever since, I try to read whenever I have the chance. I have read almost fifty books in 2020! Here is a list of my five top favorite books of all time.

      <li>The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid</li>
      <li>Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn</li>
      <li>The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd</li>
<li>The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins</li>
<li>A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman</li>
    </ol>
