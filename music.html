  <h2>Music</h2>

<p> If I had to list two things from my childhood that had the biggest impact on me, it would be Hannah Montana and One Direction. At 8 years old, I was convinced that I was Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus’s biggest fan. I thought the same thing about One Direction when I was 12. Needless to say, music is a huge part of my life. It was so hard to narrow down, but the following list is my 5 favorite musical artists. 
</p>

 <ol>
      <li>One Direction</li>
      <li>King Princess</li>
      <li>Taylor Swift</li>
 <li>Harry Styles</li>
 <li>Miley Cyrus</li>
    </ol>

<p>The following list is my top 5 favorite songs, although this list changes very often.</p>
<ol>
      <li>Honeybee by The Head and The Heart</li>
      <li>Ribs by Lorde</li>
      <li>Stupid Deep by Jon Bellion</li>
 <li>Morocco by Moon Taxi</li>
 <li>Kiwi by Harry Styles</li>
    </ol>
